            <h2 id="quote">
              Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock,
              and it will be opened to you.<br /><br />
              For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him
              who knocks it will be opened.<br /><br />

              Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread,
              will give him a stone? <br /><br />

              Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent? <br /><br />

              If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your
              children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give
              good things to those who ask Him! <br /><br />

              Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them,
              for this is the Law and the Prophets.
